This is how the deadlines work in this course.

Plan A should always be to meet the deadlines. Create a plan B if you need to, the information below should present the guidelines for plan B.



## What about a deadline in this course?

If you reach the deadline - be satisfied with yourself. It's good practice to reach a deadline. It is one of the proofs one can present of doing good work. That is what is expected of you as a professional individual.

I will grade the incoming submissions "within 15 work days".



## Can you extend a deadline "for me, please"?

> I have a real good excuse, can you extend the deadline for me?

No. That is unfair to the ones making the deadline and takes away the pressure and satisfaction of actually meeting a deadline.

I am usually not comfortable with changing deadlines, nor extending them, so consider them as being fixed to a date and to a time.

It does not depend on your excuse, it depends on my view of deadlines and how they affect the student group at large.



## What is the consequence of missing a deadline?

> What happens if I submit on Sunday or Monday or next Friday?

Missing the deadline means you are sorted in another hat (or pile). All submissions in that hat are not guaranteed to be graded within 15 working days. They are graded later, or when time gets free, or when the next re-submission date is.



## When is later?

You can be sure on that it will be graded at the next deadline for re-submission. There is "always" a next date to do re-submissions.



## What are your recommendation?

Proceed with your work. Do your best. Submit when you are done, even if its is after the deadline.

Try to improve your skills of meeting a deadline. Such skills are highly appreciated in any work environment.

Cross your thumbs and hope for the best of grading, it might come sooner, but expect the worse if you miss the deadline.
